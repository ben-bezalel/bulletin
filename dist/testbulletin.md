## Thought for the week
I hope you have had the opportunity to soak in some summer rays?! As we say goodbye to August and face a new term with ongoing uncertainties can I encourage you to read or re-read Ed's article "Life Together". If you would like it send to you please ask (it was emailed to members on 3rd August). It is based on Dietrich Bonhoeffer's 'Life Together'. I am reminded of Jonathan Freedlands Radio 4 programmes 'The Long View' where he shows how the past throws a light on situations we face now.

Today we start a new Sunday morning series "Pictures of the Church". It is difficult to exaggerate 'the importance of Christian community amidst the pressure of external hostilities'. The 7th and final point in Ed's article is 'we will truely be gathered on the last day'. Why? Because of Christ's great love"!
